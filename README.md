# command_line_webbrowser
Its a simple script/code which i built so that anyone can surf internet through commands.....  
for ex:- command prompt

I actually want to surf internet through command prompt. (want to build a headless browser which is capable of surfing any site.)

This script is useful to surf social website like facebook,linkedin and yahoo etc.
